# JavaScript Weather App
A wheater app using HTML, SCSS, and JavaScript. Try it out yourself!

## About
This app was made using JavaScript Fetch API along with async and await functions to retrieve the data from the Dark Sky API. To retrieve the users search (zipcodes), I used the (Zippopotamus)[https://zippopotam.us/] API to convert the zipcode into an geolocation. That way I could use the Dark Sky API, since it only takes geolocations to find the forecast in that location.
